# Simulated Walk - 500 Steps

This project demonstrates a 500 steps walk up the Empire State Building with random elements such as throwing dice for each step, potentially going back instead based on a dice throw & clumsiness element, using NumPy and visualizes the results with Matplotlib.

## Features
- Uses NumPy for generating random steps.
- Uses Matplotlib to visualize the walk.
- Shows trends and distribution of movement.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
